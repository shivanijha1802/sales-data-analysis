# 🧮 Sales Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Objective
Analyze sales data from a CSV file using Python and visualize insights with charts.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Files Included
- `sales.csv` - Sample sales dataset
- `sales_analysis.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with complete analysis
- `README.md` - This file

## 📊 Features
- Load and explore data from a CSV file
- Analyze total revenue per category
- Analyze total units sold per product
- Visualize insights with bar and line charts

## 📈 Charts Used
- Bar Plot (Seaborn): Revenue by Category
- Line Chart (Matplotlib): Units Sold by Product

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open `sales_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2. Ensure `sales.csv` is in the same folder.
3. Run all the code cells in order.

## ✅ Output Sample
